        <p>Crush always making me feel like I got nothing to offer
            <br>But I'm the only one that can make you feel right
            <br>I'm the only one that you think of at night
            <br>Baby, don't lie
            <br>You're always talking to me like you're totally bothered
            <br>So why you always ring at the end of my line?
            <br>Don't you got a girl that can make you feel nice?
            <br>It's a dead sign</p>

        <p>You see me as your lifeline
            <br>Other boys and girls never really made you feel right
            <br>And you can't explain why I'm always running your mind
            <br>Don't you see the answer's right in front of your eyes?</p>

        <p>You like me, oh, obviously
            <br>So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
            <br>(You'll see)
            <br>'Cause I'm supreme
            <br>(Choose me)
            <br>Other lovers give you no luck
            <br>'Cause I'm the only one that has made you fall in love
            <br>(You'll see)
            <br>So just shut up
            <br>(Choose me)</p>

        <p>Babes always flirting away, getting every number
            <br>And you can have your fun 'cause I know that it's fake
            <br>I know when you're done you'll come running my way
            <br>So I let you
            <br>Date everyone and complain that you can't find a lover
            <br>'Cause I'm the only one when the chemistry fades
            <br>I'm the only one at the end of the day
            <br>Kinda clich√©</p>

        <p>You see me as your lifeline
            <br>Other boys and girls never really made you feel right
            <br>And you can't explain why I'm always running your mind
            <br>Don't you see the answer's right in front of your eyes?</p>

        <p>I'm the one you're coming to when you're feeling alone
            <br>And I'm the only one who's gonna pick up the phone
            <br>Looking for the one but it's me all along
            <br>(Choose me)
            <br>Baby, I'm the one, yeah, that's something you've known
            <br>No, I'm not a quitter, yeah, I get what I want
            <br>Playing with your heart 'cause you give me the throne
            <br>Choose me</p>

        <p>You like me, oh, obviously
            <br>So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
            <br>(You'll see)
